# Contact Form Test Instructions

## ✅ Issues Fixed:
1. **Input Typing Issue** - Fixed form state management with proper React state updates
2. **Email Functionality** - Implemented working email system with mailto fallback
3. **Development Server** - Fixed to run from correct directory

## 🧪 How to Test:

### 1. Start the Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 2. Test Form Inputs
- Navigate to the contact section
- Try typing in each input field:
  - Full Name
  - Email Address  
  - Company Name
  - Service Interested In (dropdown)
  - Project Details (textarea)

### 3. Test Form Submission
- Fill out the form completely
- Click "Send Message"
- The form will either:
  - Send via EmailJS (if configured)
  - Open your email client with pre-filled message (mailto fallback)

## 🔧 Current Status:
- ✅ Form inputs are now responsive and allow typing
- ✅ Form validation works
- ✅ Loading states work
- ✅ Error handling works
- ✅ Success confirmation works
- ✅ Email functionality works (mailto fallback)
- ✅ All form data is properly captured

## 📧 Email Setup:
The form currently uses a mailto fallback that works immediately. To enable EmailJS:
1. Go to https://www.emailjs.com/
2. Create free account
3. Set up email service
4. Create email template
5. Update `src/config/emailjs.js` with your credentials

## 🐛 Debugging:
- Check browser console for any error messages
- Form inputs should log changes to console
- All form data should be captured correctly
